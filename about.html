        <p>
          Hello! I'm Burcu Meric, a digital artist who loves to create whimsical, colorful illustrations using my iPad. Inspired by nature, dreams, and everyday magic, my artwork celebrates the beauty of imagination and storytelling. I share my creative journey on Instagram and love connecting with others who appreciate art in all its forms.

          When I'm not drawing, you can find me sipping tea, collecting vintage books, and spending time with my cats. Thank you for visiting my little corner of the internet!
